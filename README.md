# Makeover Monday (MoM) - Week 31
**UK Recessions and Visits Abroad**

## MoM Background
Makeover Monday is a weekly learning and development opportunity to work with a given data set and create better, more effective visualizations.  The goal with MoM is to make information more accessible, and participants are from around the world.  MoM is sponsored by Tableau.  Each week, sponsors post a visualization to be improved, along with a dataset for the original visualization.  Participants then make and share their vizs and the community gets smarter and more creative as a whole!

## Source Article and Viz
This week's Viz: Week 31 brings [a viz](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w31-uk-visits-abroad) showing a time series of UK visits abroad.

## Data Source
Data is from the UKs Office for National Statistics (ONS) and available [here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/leisureandtourism/timeseries/gmax/ott).

## My Approach for Week 31
The original viz is a simple line plot of total visits, by month.  I chose to bring in another time series (UK GDP) along with the dates of UK recessions to show how the two macroeconomic variables relate to each other.
